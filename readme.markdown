What is FubuMVC.TestRunner?
--
This is a simple library of reusable conventions that are in production and are being battle tested. Eventually some of these may make their way into FubuMVC.Core but for now they exist here for my reuse and for others.

Where is CommonAssemblyInfo.cs?
--

CommonAssemblyInfo.cs is generated by the build. The build script requires Ruby with rake installed.

If you do not have ruby:

1. You need to manually create a src/CommonAssemblyInfo.cs file 

  * type: `echo // > src/CommonAssemblyInfo.cs`
  
1. open src/FubuMVC.TestRunner.sln with Visual Studio and Build the solution
