= What is FubuMVC.TestRunner?

This is a Fubu Bottle that provides you with a reusable route for running Jasmine suites. The idea is to minimize repetition when wiring up the testrunner for Jasmine and to provide a way to separate out your tests from your core code. 

= Usage

The TestRunner works by leveraging FubuMVC's ScriptManager. So the route: _/testing/suites/sample_ will run baseline Jasmine test runner code against whatever exists in the _sample_ script (which can be a file or ordered set).
For further examples, checkout the example project within the solution.

= Building locally

Where is CommonAssemblyInfo.cs?
--
CommonAssemblyInfo.cs is generated by the build. The build script requires Ruby with rake installed.

If you do not have ruby:

1. You need to manually create a src/CommonAssemblyInfo.cs file 

  * type: `echo // > src/CommonAssemblyInfo.cs`
  
1. open src/FubuMVC.TestRunner.sln with Visual Studio and Build the solution
